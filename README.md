### Learning Platforms
Places to go if you're just starting out:

- #### [OverTheWire](https://overthewire.org/wargames/)
  Get through bandit to help you get comfy typing basic commands in bash.

- #### [TryHackMe](https://tryhackme.com/)
  Very beginner friendly CTF site. *Hand-holding*. They tend to hold your hand. If you want to be thrown in the deepend, go straight to HackTheBox.

- #### [HackTheBox](https://www.hackthebox.com/)
  If you like a bit of a challenge... Great training for OSCP.

- #### [Root-Me](https://www.root-me.org/?lang=en)
  Root-Me has a nice collection of CTFs where write-ups are unavailable. If you tend to peek at solutions, this is the place to go. It forces you not to give up.

- #### [VulnHub](https://www.vulnhub.com/)
  A platform offering downloadable virtual machines designed for penetration testing practice. 

- #### [Damn Vulnerable Web Application (DVWA)](http://www.dvwa.co.uk/)
  DVWA is a deliberately insecure web application that lets you practice common web vulnerabilities like SQL injection, XSS, and more, in a controlled environment.

- #### [MetaSploitable 2](https://docs.rapid7.com/metasploit/metasploitable-2/)
